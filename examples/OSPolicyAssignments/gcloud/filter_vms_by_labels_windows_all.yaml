# An OS policy assignment to install a Windows MSI downloaded from a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
# The assignment is applied only to those VMs that have the label `windows-env-target:prod`
# assigned to them.
# Any VMs with the label `windows-env-target:test` will be excluded from the assignment.
# Note that a VM that has both labels `windows-env-target:prod` and `windows-env-target:test`
# will be excluded because the exclusion criteria has higher priority than inclusion criteria.
